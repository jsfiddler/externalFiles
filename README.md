## The following external ressources can be used

### Espacenet
A stylesheet [espacenet.css](https://jsfiddler.github.io/externalFiles/espacenet.css) and the following script(s): [espacenet.js](https://jsfiddler.github.io/externalFiles/espacenet.js).

This is a test repository. I'll try to implement more meaningful files soon. In the meantime you can test it by opening the following link: [template.html](https://jsfiddler.github.io/externalFiles/template.html)
